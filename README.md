# Reanalysis of ATAC-seq data from blood cell types
This repostiory contains reanalysis of ATAC-seq data from the following two papers:

1. Corces, M. Ryan, et al. "Lineage-specific and single-cell chromatin accessibility charts human hematopoiesis and leukemia evolution." *Nature genetics* (2016).
2. Chen, Xingqi, et al. "ATAC-see reveals the accessible genome by transposase-mediated imaging and sequencing." *Nature Methods* 13.12 (2016): 1013-1020.

The raw sequencing data were downloaded from GEO (accessions GSE74912 and GSE76006) and processed using a pipeline built with Snakemake. See [here](http://snakemake.bitbucket.org/snakemake-tutorial.html) for an introductory tutorial to Snakemake.
