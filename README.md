# Reanalysis of ChIP-seq data for TF PU.1 in lymphoblastoid cell lines



This repostiory contains reanalysis of ChIP-seq data from the following paper:

* Waszak, S. M. et al. Population variation and genetic control of modular chromatin architecture in humans. *Cell.* **162**, 1039â€“1050 (2015).

The raw sequencing data were downloaded from GEO (accessions GSE74912 and GSE76006) and processed using a pipeline built with Snakemake. See [here](http://snakemake.bitbucket.org/snakemake-tutorial.html) for an introductory tutorial to Snakemake.


Credits - Fork of https://github.com/kauralasoo/Blood_ATAC. I only look at Waszak et al 2015 data.
